# Basics of ggplot2

## Importing Required Libraries

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

# Hereâ€™s how to create a simple scatter plot using the mpg dataset:

ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point()

# Enhance your plots with themes:

ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Fuel Efficiency by Engine Size",
       x = "Engine Displacement (L)",
       y = "Highway Miles per Gallon")

# You can also divide the plot by a categorical variable:

ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ class)

# By now, you should have a foundational understanding of ggplot2. Start experimenting with your own datasets and unlock the power of data visualization!
